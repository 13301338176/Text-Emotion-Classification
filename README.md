## Text Emotion Classification

In this project, we try to the classify the text according to the emotion that it represents. This is multi class sentiment analysis problem. We combine three different datasets, namely [equity evaluation corpus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abishekarun/Text-Emotion-Classification/master/Equity-Evaluation-Corpus.csv), [text emotion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abishekarun/Text-Emotion-Classification/master/text_emotion.csv) and [cleaned tweets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abishekarun/Text-Emotion-Classification/master/tweets_clean.txt) to create the large dataset used in this problem.

The Jupyter Notebook file is [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Text-Emotion-Classification/blob/master/emotion_classification.ipynb) for this project.
